            <p>
              As a Research Assistant for the University of Sussex School of Psychology Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Committee, I developed reproducible R scripts to support three projects. 
              Analyses for the <a href="https://ref.ac.uk/" class="link">Research Excellence Framework</a> (REF) selection process, and <a href="https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan-charter" class="link">Athena Swan</a> focused on promoting gender equity, 
              while the Inclusive Culture Survey (ICS) assessed differences in experiences, perceptions and opportunities across a wide range of demographic characteristics.

            <p><strong>Key Contributions</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>REF:</strong> Developed an R script to generate clear HTML summary reports including statistical analyses and visualisations of results, assessing gender differences in paper submission rates and testing for potential bias at each stage of the selection process.</li>
              <li><strong>ICS:</strong> Designed a reproducible R script to produce interactive HTML reports with nested tables, descriptive and inferential statistics, and visualisations. The script was designed to handle annual datasets, updating current-year analyses while tracking changes over time.</li>
              <li><strong>Athena Swan:</strong> Extracted gender-related findings from ICS data and automated exports to Excel and Word reports to support Athena Swan submissions.</li>

            <p>My project built on work I was involved in at Sussex Attention Lab, seeking to develop an <a href="https://github.com/Sussex-Neuroscience/inclusive-eeg-cap" class="link">EEG cap</a> that easily and effectively accommodates all hair types.
            I worked under the supervision of Dr Chris Racey, with mentorship from Dr Paloma Manguele and Dr Andre Maia-Chagas.</p>
            <p>The prototype was shown as part of Sussex Neuroscience Open Science Demos at the British Neuroscience Association 2023 International Festival of Neuroscience.</p>

            <p>I undertook this role during a placement year as part of my undergraduate degree and was involved in two main projects:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I joined the <a href="https://github.com/Sussex-Neuroscience/inclusive-EEG-electrodes" class="link">Inclusive Electrode Project (IEP)</a> which aims to produce an open source EEG electrode system that holds electrodes in place equally well to conventional caps but overcoming the limits of caps when applied to individuals with voluminous, thick or curly hair.
                We presented this work at the Sussex Neuroscience Showcase (2022) and the Sussex Neuroscience Open Science Demos at the British Neuroscience Association 2023 International Festival of Neuroscience.</li>
                <li>I was heavily involved in conducting a <a href="https://osf.io/ph9en?mode=&revisionId=&view_only=" class="link">new study</a> that investigates associations between ADHD symptomatology and semantic distance in a word association task.</li>
            </ul>
              In addition to these, I provided supplementary support to various other projects.
